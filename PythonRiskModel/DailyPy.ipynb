    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop predictive models on the Bank Marketing dataset. This dataset contains information related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, with the primary goal of predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The project aims to gain insights into customer behavior, demographics, and economic indicators and build predictive models to improve campaign efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable 'y') based on various demographic and marketing-related features. The problem is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify potential clients as subscribers ('yes') or non-subscribers ('no').\n",
