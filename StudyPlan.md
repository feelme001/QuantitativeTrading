Day 4 (Thursday): Calculate Average Daily Returns and Volatility
Average Daily Returns:

Calculate the average daily return for each stock.
Volatility Measurement:

Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns for each stock, which represents the volatility.
Day 5 (Friday): Visualizing Risk vs. Return Done 1-7-2024
Risk-Return Scatter Plot:
Create a scatter plot with average daily returns on the x-axis and volatility on the y-axis.
This plot will help in understanding the risk-return profile of each stock.
Weekend (Saturday & Sunday): Deeper Comparative Analysis Done 1-7-2024
Correlation Analysis:

Compute and visualize the correlation matrix of daily returns of the stocks. This shows how closely the movements of different stocks are related.
Extended Visualization:

Based on your interest, explore other visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, or area charts for different aspects of the stock data.
Documentation and Review:

Document your findings and observations from the comparative analysis.
Review your code for efficiency and clarity.
Outcome for Week 2:
A deeper understanding of how different stocks compare in terms of performance, risk, and return.
Enhanced skills in Python for data manipulation and visualization in a financial context.
Remember, the goal of this week is to deepen your comparative analysis skills and understand the relationships between different stocks. If you have any questions or need assistance with specific parts of the analysis, feel free to ask!

Week 4: Portfolio Optimization
Objective:
Learn about and apply the principles of portfolio optimization, including the calculation of portfolio returns and risks, and explore basic portfolio optimization strategies.

Tasks for Week 4:
Day 1 (Monday): Understanding Portfolio Theory
Study Portfolio Theory:
Understand the basics of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which focuses on optimizing the balance between risk and return in a portfolio.
Learn about key concepts like diversification, the efficient frontier, and risk-return trade-off.
Day 2 (Tuesday): Calculate Portfolio Return
Define a Sample Portfolio:

Create a hypothetical portfolio by selecting stocks and assigning weights to them (e.g., 40% AAPL, 30% MSFT, 20% AMZN, 10% GOOGL).
Calculate Portfolio Return:

Calculate the expected portfolio return based on individual stock returns and their respective weights.
Sample Python Code for Portfolio Return:
python
Copy code
# Define portfolio weights
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1])

# Daily returns for each stock
portfolio_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'AAPL': aapl_data['Daily Return'],
    'MSFT': msft_data['Daily Return'],
    'AMZN': amzn_data['Daily Return'],
    'GOOGL': googl_data['Daily Return']
})

# Calculate portfolio return
portfolio_return = np.sum(weights * portfolio_data.mean()) * 252  # Annualize return
print("Expected annual portfolio return:", portfolio_return)
Day 3 (Wednesday): Calculate Portfolio Risk
Calculate Portfolio Risk:
Understand how to calculate portfolio risk, considering both individual stock volatilities and correlations between stocks.
Use the variance-covariance matrix and portfolio weights to calculate the portfolio's standard deviation (risk).
Sample Python Code for Portfolio Risk:
python
Copy code
# Calculate the covariance matrix
cov_matrix = portfolio_data.cov() * 252  # Annualize covariance

# Calculate portfolio risk
portfolio_risk = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights)))
print("Portfolio Risk (Standard Deviation):", portfolio_risk)
Day 4 (Thursday): Explore Basic Portfolio Optimization
Basic Portfolio Optimization:
Experiment with different weight allocations to see how they affect the portfolio's expected return and risk.
Understand the concept of the efficient frontier in the context of your stock selection.
Day 5 (Friday): Summarize Insights and Strategy
Document Your Analysis:
Summarize your findings from the portfolio optimization exercises.
Discuss how changing weights affects risk and return.
Weekend: Advanced Portfolio Concepts
Further Learning:
If you're interested, start exploring more advanced portfolio optimization techniques, such as using the Sharpe Ratio for optimization or applying constraints to the optimization problem.
Consider learning about software packages that can handle more complex optimization problems, like cvxpy or optimization modules in scipy.
