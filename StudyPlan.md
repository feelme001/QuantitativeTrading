Week 2: Comparative Stock Analysis
Objective:
Compare the performance of multiple stocks by analyzing metrics like cumulative returns, average daily returns, and visualize the comparisons.

Tasks:
Day 1 (Monday): Data Fetching and Initial Setup Done 1-7-2024
Fetch Additional Stock Data:

Choose additional stocks for comparison. For instance, consider adding stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), or other major companies.
Fetch their data using yfinance for the same date range as AAPL and MSFT.
Initial Data Exploration:

Inspect the newly fetched data, similarly to how you did with AAPL and MSFT in Week 1.
Day 2 (Tuesday): Calculate Cumulative Returns Done 1-7-2024
Cumulative Returns Calculation:
Calculate the cumulative returns for each stock. The formula for cumulative return is (1 + daily_return).cumprod().
Add the cumulative returns as a new column to each stock's DataFrame.
Day 3 (Wednesday): Comparative Analysis of Cumulative Returns Done 1-7-2024
Plot Comparative Cumulative Returns:
Create a line plot to compare the cumulative returns of all the selected stocks over time.
This will help visualize which stocks have performed better over the period.
Day 4 (Thursday): Calculate Average Daily Returns and Volatility
Average Daily Returns:

Calculate the average daily return for each stock.
Volatility Measurement:

Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns for each stock, which represents the volatility.
Day 5 (Friday): Visualizing Risk vs. Return Done 1-7-2024
Risk-Return Scatter Plot:
Create a scatter plot with average daily returns on the x-axis and volatility on the y-axis.
This plot will help in understanding the risk-return profile of each stock.
Weekend (Saturday & Sunday): Deeper Comparative Analysis Done 1-7-2024
Correlation Analysis:

Compute and visualize the correlation matrix of daily returns of the stocks. This shows how closely the movements of different stocks are related.
Extended Visualization:

Based on your interest, explore other visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, or area charts for different aspects of the stock data.
Documentation and Review:

Document your findings and observations from the comparative analysis.
Review your code for efficiency and clarity.
Outcome for Week 2:
A deeper understanding of how different stocks compare in terms of performance, risk, and return.
Enhanced skills in Python for data manipulation and visualization in a financial context.
Remember, the goal of this week is to deepen your comparative analysis skills and understand the relationships between different stocks. If you have any questions or need assistance with specific parts of the analysis, feel free to ask!

### Week 3: Moving Average and Volatility Analysis
#### Monday to Friday (1 Hour/Day)
- Monday: Study moving averages and calculate them for a chosen stock.
- Tuesday: Implement the calculation of long-term moving averages.
- Wednesday: Begin calculating stock volatility (standard deviation of returns).
- Thursday: Plot the short-term and long-term moving averages on the stock price chart.
- Friday: Add volatility plots to your analysis.
#### Saturday & Sunday (3 Hours/Day)
- Saturday:
First Hour: Review and refine your plots.
Next Two Hours: Write an interpretation of the moving averages and volatility in the context of stock performance.
- Sunday:
First Hour: Document your code and findings.
Next Two Hours: Apply your analysis to a different set of stocks for comparison.
```
Tasks for Week 3:
Day 1 (Monday): Understand and Calculate Moving Averages
Learn About Moving Averages:

Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trends. Common types are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
The SMA is an average of stock prices over a specific number of days, while the EMA gives more weight to recent prices.
Calculate Moving Averages:

Calculate short-term (e.g., 20-day) and long-term (e.g., 50-day) SMAs for each stock.
Use Pandas’ rolling().mean() function for SMA.
Sample Python Code for SMA:
python
Copy code
# Calculate 20-day and 50-day SMAs for AAPL
aapl_data['20-day SMA'] = aapl_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
aapl_data['50-day SMA'] = aapl_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
Day 2 (Tuesday): Plot Moving Averages
Visualize Moving Averages:
Plot the moving averages along with the closing prices of the stocks.
This helps in visualizing trends and potential crossover points which are often considered as buy/sell signals.
Sample Python Code for Plotting:
python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(aapl_data['Close'], label='AAPL Close')
plt.plot(aapl_data['20-day SMA'], label='20-day SMA')
plt.plot(aapl_data['50-day SMA'], label='50-day SMA')
plt.title('AAPL Close Price and Moving Averages')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Day 3 (Wednesday): Understand and Calculate Volatility
Learn About Volatility:

Volatility is a measure of the price variations of a stock over time. High volatility means high price fluctuations.
Calculate Volatility:

Calculate the annualized volatility, using the standard deviation of daily returns multiplied by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (commonly used: √252).
Sample Python Code for Volatility:
python
Copy code
# Calculate annualized volatility for AAPL
aapl_volatility = aapl_data['Daily Return'].std() * np.sqrt(252)
print("AAPL Annualized Volatility:", aapl_volatility)
Day 4 (Thursday): Comparative Analysis of Moving Averages and Volatility
Compare Moving Averages and Volatility Across Stocks:
Analyze how different stocks behave in terms of their moving averages and volatility.
Compare their trends and stability.
Day 5 (Friday): Summarize Insights
Document Your Analysis:
Write a summary of your findings from the moving average and volatility analysis.
Highlight key trends, potential trading signals, and risk profiles of different stocks.
Weekend: Reflect and Explore Further
Reflection and Further Study:
Reflect on how these analyses might inform investment decisions.
Consider exploring other technical indicators or timeframes for a more comprehensive analysis.
